# WP Direction #

Waypoint direction panel indicates the direction to the next waypoint, relative to your plane.

You need a magnetometer to make this panel work more precisely.

It still works well with only GPS, but when there is strong wind, than it can show a bit different waypoint direction (usually it is a good approximation).
