# ArduCAM OSD Config #

## The easiest way to setup your MinimOSD ##

Thanks to Michael Oborne, we have now an incredible customization and the easiest setup of all MinimOSD's resources.<br>
With ArduCAM OSD Config you can do all the job in just one place.<br>
Everything, from update firmware or charset to enable/disable and positioning panels.<br>
<br>
Our friends from MinimOSD-Extra's project gave us some awesome contributions making it even more useful and powerful.<br>
