The project is about providing camera solutions for UAV projects as telemetry over OSD and/or camera control, etc.
As the project is based on Arduino, it can be hacked to fit many other applications.

<b><a href='minimosd.md'>MinimOSD:</a></b> is a product board from DIYDrones and 3DRobotics which provides OSD telemetry out-of-the-box to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/ardupilot-mega/wiki/home'>ArduPilot Mega</a>.<br>
<br>
MinimOSD is the perfect solution for attaching FPV cameras to your drones.<br>
It adds telemetry data to the video signal coming from the camera aboard by reading <a href='http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start'>MAVLink</a> messages from ArduPilot's telemetry port.
