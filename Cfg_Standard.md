# Video Standards #

Setting video standards is done trough the OSD Config Tool.

It can be set in the "Video Mode" menu.

It is very different from the original "guessing" method, since it will always boot in the mode you select. After changing this option don't forget to do a "Save current tab to OSD" in the configuration panel, so MinimOSD EEPROM is updated.
